# HandDigitRecognition

Solution is built on Deep Learning with Keras and Tensor Flow. Model generates accuracy of 99.17% on test data.
Model progresses through 4 key steps - Convolution -> Poooling -> Flattening -> Full Connection.
It uses 'softmax' as activation function and 'RMSProp' as optimizer.
We compared the this model with model builr on SVM ( Suppor Vector machine ) , but accuracy with NN is higher than that of SVM
